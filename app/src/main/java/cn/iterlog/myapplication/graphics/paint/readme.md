Inherited methods
From class java.lang.Object
Constants
ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG
Paint flag that enables antialiasing when drawing.

Enabling this flag will cause all draw operations that support antialiasing to use it.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

DEV_KERN_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int DEV_KERN_TEXT_FLAG
Legacy Paint flag, no longer used.

Constant Value: 256 (0x00000100)

DITHER_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int DITHER_FLAG
Paint flag that enables dithering when blitting.

Enabling this flag applies a dither to any blit operation where the target's colour space is more constrained than the source.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

EMBEDDED_BITMAP_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 19
int EMBEDDED_BITMAP_TEXT_FLAG
Paint flag that enables the use of bitmap fonts when drawing text.

Disabling this flag will prevent text draw operations from using embedded bitmap strikes in fonts, causing fonts with both scalable outlines and bitmap strikes to draw only the scalable outlines, and fonts with only bitmap strikes to not draw at all.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 1024 (0x00000400)

FAKE_BOLD_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int FAKE_BOLD_TEXT_FLAG
Paint flag that applies a synthetic bolding effect to drawn text.

Enabling this flag will cause text draw operations to apply a simulated bold effect when drawing a Typeface that is not already bold.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 32 (0x00000020)

FILTER_BITMAP_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int FILTER_BITMAP_FLAG
Paint flag that enables bilinear sampling on scaled bitmaps.

If cleared, scaled bitmaps will be drawn with nearest neighbor sampling, likely resulting in artifacts. This should generally be on when drawing bitmaps, unless performance-bound (rendering to software canvas) or preferring pixelation artifacts to blurriness when scaling significantly.

If bitmaps are scaled for device density at creation time (as resource bitmaps often are) the filtering will already have been done.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

HINTING_OFF

Added in API level 14
int HINTING_OFF
Font hinter option that disables font hinting.

See also:

setHinting(int)
Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

HINTING_ON

Added in API level 14
int HINTING_ON
Font hinter option that enables font hinting.

See also:

setHinting(int)
Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

LINEAR_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int LINEAR_TEXT_FLAG
Paint flag that enables smooth linear scaling of text.

Enabling this flag does not actually scale text, but rather adjusts text draw operations to deal gracefully with smooth adjustment of scale. When this flag is enabled, font hinting is disabled to prevent shape deformation between scale factors, and glyph caching is disabled due to the large number of glyph images that will be generated.

SUBPIXEL_TEXT_FLAG should be used in conjunction with this flag to prevent glyph positions from snapping to whole pixel values as scale factor is adjusted.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 64 (0x00000040)

STRIKE_THRU_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int STRIKE_THRU_TEXT_FLAG
Paint flag that applies a strike-through decoration to drawn text.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 16 (0x00000010)

SUBPIXEL_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 1
int SUBPIXEL_TEXT_FLAG
Paint flag that enables subpixel positioning of text.

Enabling this flag causes glyph advances to be computed with subpixel accuracy.

This can be used with LINEAR_TEXT_FLAG to prevent text from jittering during smooth scale transitions.

See also:

Paint(int)
setFlags(int)
Constant Value: 128 (0x00000080)

UNDERLINE_TEXT_FLAG

Added in API level 1

                int contextStart, 
                int contextEnd, 
                boolean isRtl, 
                float advance)
Get the character offset within the string whose position is closest to the specified horizontal position.

The returned value is generally the value of offset for which getRunAdvance(char[], int, int, int, int, boolean, int) yields a result most closely approximating advance, and which is also on a grapheme cluster boundary. As such, it is the preferred method for positioning a cursor in response to a touch or pointer event. The grapheme cluster boundaries are based on Unicode Standard Annex #29 but with some tailoring for better user experience.

Note that advance is a (generally positive) width measurement relative to the start of the run. Thus, for RTL runs it the distance from the point to the right edge.

All indices are relative to the start of text. Further, 0 <= contextStart <= start <= end <= contextEnd <= text.length must hold on entry, and start <= result <= end will hold on return.

Parameters
text	char: the text to measure. Cannot be null.
start	int: the index of the start of the range to measure
end	int: the index + 1 of the end of the range to measure
contextStart	int: the index of the start of the shaping context
contextEnd	int: the index + 1 of the end of the range to measure
isRtl	boolean: whether the run is in RTL direction
advance	float: width relative to start of run
Returns
int	index of offset

                int contextEnd, 
                boolean isRtl, 
                float advance)
Parameters
text	CharSequence: the text to measure. Cannot be null.
start	int: the index of the start of the range to measure
end	int: the index + 1 of the end of the range to measure
contextStart	int: the index of the start of the shaping context
contextEnd	int: the index + 1 of the end of the range to measure

getPathEffect

Added in API level 1
PathEffect getPathEffect ()
Get the paint's patheffect object.

Returns
PathEffect	the paint's patheffect (or null)
getRasterizer

Added in API level 1
Rasterizer getRasterizer ()
This method was deprecated in API level 21.
Rasterizer is not supported by either the HW or PDF backends.

Get the paint's rasterizer (or null).

The raster controls/modifies how paths/text are turned into alpha masks.

Returns
Rasterizer	the paint's rasterizer (or null)
getRunAdvance

Added in API level 23
float getRunAdvance (char[] text, 
                int start, 
                int end, 
                int contextStart, 
                int contextEnd, 
                boolean isRtl, 
                int offset)
Measure cursor position within a run of text.

The run of text includes the characters from start to end in the text. In addition, the range contextStart to contextEnd is used as context for the purpose of complex text shaping, such as Arabic text potentially shaped differently based on the text next to it.

All text outside the range contextStart..contextEnd is ignored. The text between start and end will be laid out to be measured.

The returned width measurement is the advance from start to offset. It is generally a positive value, no matter the direction of the run. If offset == end, the return value is simply the width of the whole run from start to end.

Ligatures are formed for characters in the range start..end (but not for start..contextStart or end..contextEnd). If offset points to a character in the middle of such a formed ligature, but at a grapheme cluster boundary, the return value will also reflect an advance in the middle of the ligature. See getOffsetForAdvance(char[], int, int, int, int, boolean, float) for more discussion of grapheme cluster boundaries.

The direction of the run is explicitly specified by isRtl. Thus, this method is suitable only for runs of a single direction.

All indices are relative to the start of text. Further, 0 <= contextStart <= start <= offset <= end <= contextEnd <= text.length must hold on entry.

Parameters
text	char: the text to measure. Cannot be null.
start	int: the index of the start of the range to measure
end	int: the index + 1 of the end of the range to measure
contextStart	int: the index of the start of the shaping context
contextEnd	int: the index + 1 of the end of the shaping context
isRtl	boolean: whether the run is in RTL direction
offset	int: index of caret position
Returns
float	width measurement between start and offset

setTextLocale

Added in API level 17
void setTextLocale (Locale locale)
Set the text locale list to a one-member list consisting of just the locale. See setTextLocales(LocaleList) for how the locale list affects the way the text is drawn for some languages.

Parameters
locale	Locale: the paint's locale value for drawing text, must not be null.
setTextLocales

Added in API level 24
void setTextLocales (LocaleList locales)
Set the text locale list. The text locale list affects how the text is drawn for some languages. For example, if the locale list contains CHINESE or CHINA, then the text renderer will prefer to draw text using a Chinese font. Likewise, if the locale list contains JAPANESE or JAPAN, then the text renderer will prefer to draw text using a Japanese font. If the locale list contains both, the order those locales appear in the list is considered for deciding the font. This distinction is important because Chinese and Japanese text both use many of the same Unicode code points but their appearance is subtly different for each language. By default, the text locale list is initialized to a one-member list just containing the system locales. This assumes that the text to be rendered will most likely be in the user's preferred language. If the actual language or languages of the text is/are known, then they can be provided to the text renderer using this method. The text renderer may attempt to guess the language script based on the contents of the text to be drawn independent of the text locale here. Specifying the text locales just helps it do a better job in certain ambiguous cases.
