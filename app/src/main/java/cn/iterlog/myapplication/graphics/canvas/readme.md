Canvas
public class Canvas 
extends Object 

java.lang.Object
   â†³	android.graphics.Canvas

The Canvas class holds the "draw" calls. To draw something, you need 4 basic components: A Bitmap to hold the pixels, a Canvas to host the draw calls (writing into the bitmap), a drawing primitive (e.g. Rect, Path, text, Bitmap), and a paint (to describe the colors and styles for the drawing).

right	float
bottom	float
startAngle	float: Starting angle (in degrees) where the arc begins
sweepAngle	float: Sweep angle (in degrees) measured clockwise

Added in API level 3
void drawBitmap (int[] colors,

                int stride, 
                float x, 
                float y,

                int height, 
                boolean hasAlpha, 
                Paint paint)
This method was deprecated in API level 21.
Usage with a hardware accelerated canvas requires an internal copy of color buffer contents every time this method is called. Using a Bitmap avoids this copy, and allows the application to more explicitly control the lifetime and copies of pixel data.

Treat the specified array of colors as a bitmap, and draw it. This gives the same result as first creating a bitmap from the array, and then drawing it, but this method avoids explicitly creating a bitmap object which can be more efficient if the colors are changing often.

Parameters
colors	int: Array of colors representing the pixels of the bitmap
offset	int: Offset into the array of colors for the first pixel
stride	int: The number of colors in the array between rows (must be >= width or <= -width).
x	float: The X coordinate for where to draw the bitmap
y	float: The Y coordinate for where to draw the bitmap
width	int: The width of the bitmap
height	int: The height of the bitmap
hasAlpha	boolean: True if the alpha channel of the colors contains valid values. If false, the alpha byte is ignored (assumed to be 0xFF for every pixel).
paint	Paint: May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap

                Paint paint)
This method was deprecated in API level 21.
Usage with a hardware accelerated canvas requires an internal copy of color buffer contents every time this method is called. Using a Bitmap avoids this copy, and allows the application to more explicitly control the lifetime and copies of pixel data.

Legacy version of drawBitmap(int[] colors, ...) that took ints for x,y

x	int
y	int
width	int
height	int
hasAlpha	boolean
paint	Paint
drawBitmap

Added in API level 1
void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, 
                Rect src, 
                Rect dst, 
                Paint paint)
Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to draw.

Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated.

This function ignores the density associated with the bitmap. This is because the source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must already have the appropriate scaling factor applied.

Parameters
bitmap	Bitmap: The bitmap to be drawn
src	Rect: May be null. The subset of the bitmap to be drawn
dst	Rect: The rectangle that the bitmap will be scaled/translated to fit into
paint	Paint: May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap

                Paint paint)
Draw the specified bitmap, with its top/left corner at (x,y), using the specified paint, transformed by the current matrix.

Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated.

If the bitmap and canvas have different densities, this function will take care of automatically scaling the bitmap to draw at the same density as the canvas.

Parameters
bitmap	Bitmap: The bitmap to be drawn
left	float: The position of the left side of the bitmap being drawn
top	float: The position of the top side of the bitmap being drawn
paint	Paint: The paint used to draw the bitmap (may be null)
drawBitmap

Added in API level 1
void drawBitmap (Bitmap bitmap, 
                Rect src, 
                RectF dst, 
                Paint paint)
Draw the specified bitmap, scaling/translating automatically to fill the destination rectangle. If the source rectangle is not null, it specifies the subset of the bitmap to draw.

Note: if the paint contains a maskfilter that generates a mask which extends beyond the bitmap's original width/height (e.g. BlurMaskFilter), then the bitmap will be drawn as if it were in a Shader with CLAMP mode. Thus the color outside of the original width/height will be the edge color replicated.

This function ignores the density associated with the bitmap. This is because the source and destination rectangle coordinate spaces are in their respective densities, so must already have the appropriate scaling factor applied.

Parameters
bitmap	Bitmap: The bitmap to be drawn
src	Rect: May be null. The subset of the bitmap to be drawn
dst	RectF: The rectangle that the bitmap will be scaled/translated to fit into
paint	Paint: May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap

                int vertOffset, 
                int[] colors, 
                int colorOffset, 
                Paint paint)
Draw the bitmap through the mesh, where mesh vertices are evenly distributed across the bitmap. There are meshWidth+1 vertices across, and meshHeight+1 vertices down. The verts array is accessed in row-major order, so that the first meshWidth+1 vertices are distributed across the top of the bitmap from left to right. A more general version of this method is drawVertices().

Parameters
bitmap	Bitmap: The bitmap to draw using the mesh
meshWidth	int: The number of columns in the mesh. Nothing is drawn if this is 0
meshHeight	int: The number of rows in the mesh. Nothing is drawn if this is 0
verts	float: Array of x,y pairs, specifying where the mesh should be drawn. There must be at least (meshWidth+1) * (meshHeight+1) * 2 + vertOffset values in the array
vertOffset	int: Number of verts elements to skip before drawing
colors	int: May be null. Specifies a color at each vertex, which is interpolated across the cell, and whose values are multiplied by the corresponding bitmap colors. If not null, there must be at least (meshWidth+1) * (meshHeight+1) + colorOffset values in the array.
colorOffset	int: Number of color elements to skip before drawing
paint	Paint: May be null. The paint used to draw the bitmap

                float stopY, 
                Paint paint)
Draw a line segment with the specified start and stop x,y coordinates, using the specified paint.

Note that since a line is always "framed", the Style is ignored in the paint.

Degenerate lines (length is 0) will not be drawn.

Parameters
startX	float: The x-coordinate of the start point of the line
startY	float: The y-coordinate of the start point of the line
stopX	float

                int count, 
                Paint paint)
Draw a series of lines. Each line is taken from 4 consecutive values in the pts array. Thus to draw 1 line, the array must contain at least 4 values. This is logically the same as drawing the array as follows: drawLine(pts[0], pts[1], pts[2], pts[3]) followed by drawLine(pts[4], pts[5], pts[6], pts[7]) and so on.

Parameters
pts	float: Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...]
offset	int: Number of values in the array to skip before drawing.
count	int: The number of values in the array to process, after skipping "offset" of them. Since each line uses 4 values, the number of "lines" that are drawn is really (count >> 2).

                int count, 
                Paint paint)
Draw a series of points. Each point is centered at the coordinate specified by pts[], and its diameter is specified by the paint's stroke width (as transformed by the canvas' CTM), with special treatment for a stroke width of 0, which always draws exactly 1 pixel (or at most 4 if antialiasing is enabled). The shape of the point is controlled by the paint's Cap type. The shape is a square, unless the cap type is Round, in which case the shape is a circle.

Parameters
pts	float: Array of points to draw [x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 ...]
offset	int: Number of values to skip before starting to draw.

                boolean isRtl, 
                Paint paint)
Draw a run of text, all in a single direction, with optional context for complex text shaping.

See drawTextRun(CharSequence, int, int, int, int, float, float, boolean, Paint) for more details. This method uses a character array rather than CharSequence to represent the string. Also, to be consistent with the pattern established in drawText(char[], int, int, float, float, Paint), in this method count and contextCount are used rather than offsets of the end position; count = end - start, contextCount = contextEnd - contextStart.

Parameters
text	char: the text to render
index	int: the start of the text to render
count	int: the count of chars to render
contextIndex	int: the start of the context for shaping. Must be no greater than index.
contextCount	int: the number of characters in the context for shaping. contexIndex + contextCount must be no less than index + count.
x	float: the x position at which to draw the text
y	float: the y position at which to draw the text
isRtl	boolean: whether the run is in RTL direction
paint	Paint: the paint
drawTextRun

Added in API level 23
void drawTextRun (CharSequence text, 
                int start, 
                int end, 
                int contextStart, 
                int contextEnd, 
                float x, 
                float y, 
                boolean isRtl, 
                Paint paint)
Draw a run of text, all in a single direction, with optional context for complex text shaping.

The run of text includes the characters from start to end in the text. In addition, the range contextStart to contextEnd is used as context for the purpose of complex text shaping, such as Arabic text potentially shaped differently based on the text next to it.

All text outside the range contextStart..contextEnd is ignored. The text between start and end will be laid out and drawn.

The direction of the run is explicitly specified by isRtl. Thus, this method is suitable only for runs of a single direction. Alignment of the text is as determined by the Paint's TextAlign value. Further, 0 <= contextStart <= start <= end <= contextEnd <= text.length must hold on entry.

Also see getRunAdvance(char[], int, int, int, int, boolean, int) for a corresponding method to measure the text; the advance width of the text drawn matches the value obtained from that method.

Parameters
text	CharSequence: the text to render
start	int: the start of the text to render. Data before this position can be used for shaping context.
end	int: the end of the text to render. Data at or after this position can be used for shaping context.
contextStart	int: the index of the start of the shaping context
contextEnd	int: the index of the end of the shaping context
x	float: the x position at which to draw the text
y	float: the y position at which to draw the text
isRtl	boolean: whether the run is in RTL direction
paint	Paint: the paint

drawVertices

Added in API level 1
void drawVertices (Canvas.VertexMode mode, 
                int vertexCount, 
                float[] verts, 
                int vertOffset, 
                float[] texs, 
                int texOffset, 
                int[] colors, 
                int colorOffset, 
                short[] indices, 
                int indexOffset, 
                int indexCount, 
                Paint paint)
Draw the array of vertices, interpreted as triangles (based on mode). The verts array is required, and specifies the x,y pairs for each vertex. If texs is non-null, then it is used to specify the coordinate in shader coordinates to use at each vertex (the paint must have a shader in this case). If there is no texs array, but there is a color array, then each color is interpolated across its corresponding triangle in a gradient. If both texs and colors arrays are present, then they behave as before, but the resulting color at each pixels is the result of multiplying the colors from the shader and the color-gradient together. The indices array is optional, but if it is present, then it is used to specify the index of each triangle, rather than just walking through the arrays in order.

Parameters
mode	Canvas.VertexMode: How to interpret the array of vertices
vertexCount	int: The number of values in the vertices array (and corresponding texs and colors arrays if non-null). Each logical vertex is two values (x, y), vertexCount must be a multiple of 2.
verts	float: Array of vertices for the mesh
vertOffset	int: Number of values in the verts to skip before drawing.
texs	float: May be null. If not null, specifies the coordinates to sample into the current shader (e.g. bitmap tile or gradient)
texOffset	int: Number of values in texs to skip before drawing.
colors	int: May be null. If not null, specifies a color for each vertex, to be interpolated across the triangle.
colorOffset	int: Number of values in colors to skip before drawing.
indices	short: If not null, array of indices to reference into the vertex (texs, colors) array.
indexOffset	int
indexCount	int: number of entries in the indices array (if not null).
paint	Paint: Specifies the shader to use if the texs array is non-null.
getClipBounds

Added in API level 1
boolean getClipBounds (Rect bounds)
Return the bounds of the current clip (in local coordinates) in the bounds parameter, and return true if it is non-empty. This can be useful in a way similar to quickReject, in that it tells you that drawing outside of these bounds will be clipped out.

int	the height of the current drawing layer
getMatrix

Added in API level 1
Matrix getMatrix ()
This method was deprecated in API level 16.
Hardware accelerated canvases may have any matrix when passed to a View or Drawable, as it is implementation defined where in the hierarchy such canvases are created. It is recommended in such cases to either draw contents irrespective of the current matrix, or to track relevant transform state outside of the canvas.

Return a new matrix with a copy of the canvas' current transformation matrix.

Returns
Matrix	
getMatrix

Added in API level 1
void getMatrix (Matrix ctm)
This method was deprecated in API level 16.
Hardware accelerated canvases may have any matrix when passed to a View or Drawable, as it is implementation defined where in the hierarchy such canvases are created. It is recommended in such cases to either draw contents irrespective of the current matrix, or to track relevant transform state outside of the canvas.

Return, in ctm, the current transformation matrix. This does not alter the matrix in the canvas, but just returns a copy of it.

Parameters
ctm	Matrix
getMaximumBitmapHeight

Added in API level 14
int getMaximumBitmapHeight ()
Returns the maximum allowed height for bitmaps drawn with this canvas. Attempting to draw with a bitmap taller than this value will result in an error.

Returns
int	
See also:

getMaximumBitmapWidth()
getMaximumBitmapWidth

Added in API level 14
int getMaximumBitmapWidth ()
Returns the maximum allowed width for bitmaps drawn with this canvas. Attempting to draw with a bitmap wider than this value will result in an error.

Returns
int	
See also:

getMaximumBitmapHeight()
getSaveCount

Added in API level 1
int getSaveCount ()
Returns the number of matrix/clip states on the Canvas' private stack. This will equal # save() calls - # restore() calls.

Returns
int	
getWidth

int getWidth ()
Returns the width of the current drawing layer

Returns
int	the width of the current drawing layer
isHardwareAccelerated

Added in API level 11

Indicates whether this Canvas uses hardware acceleration. Note that this method does not define what type of hardware acceleration may or may not be used.

Returns
boolean	True if drawing operations are hardware accelerated, false otherwise.
isOpaque

Added in API level 1
boolean isOpaque ()
Return true if the device that the current layer draws into is opaque (i.e. does not support per-pixel alpha).

quickReject

Added in API level 1
boolean quickReject (float left, 
                float top, 
                float right, 
                float bottom, 
                Canvas.EdgeType type)
Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls).

Parameters
left	float: The left side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip
top	float: The top of the rectangle to compare with the current clip
right	float: The right side of the rectangle to compare with the current clip
bottom	float: The bottom of the rectangle to compare with the current clip
type	Canvas.EdgeType: AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW).
Returns
boolean	true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
quickReject

Added in API level 1
boolean quickReject (Path path, 
                Canvas.EdgeType type)
Return true if the specified path, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls). Note: for speed it may return false even if the path itself might not intersect the clip (i.e. the bounds of the path intersects, but the path does not).

Parameters
path	Path: The path to compare with the current clip
type	Canvas.EdgeType: AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW).
Returns
boolean	true if the path (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
quickReject

Added in API level 1
boolean quickReject (RectF rect, 
                Canvas.EdgeType type)
Return true if the specified rectangle, after being transformed by the current matrix, would lie completely outside of the current clip. Call this to check if an area you intend to draw into is clipped out (and therefore you can skip making the draw calls).

Parameters
rect	RectF: the rect to compare with the current clip
type	Canvas.EdgeType: AA if the path should be considered antialiased, since that means it may affect a larger area (more pixels) than non-antialiased (BW).
Returns
boolean	true if the rect (transformed by the canvas' matrix) does not intersect with the canvas' clip
restore

Added in API level 1
void restore ()
This call balances a previous call to save(), and is used to remove all modifications to the matrix/clip state since the last save call. It is an error to call restore() more times than save() was called.

restoreToCount

Added in API level 1
void restoreToCount (int saveCount)
Efficient way to pop any calls to save() that happened after the save count reached saveCount. It is an error for saveCount to be less than 1. Example: int count = canvas.save(); ... // more calls potentially to save() canvas.restoreToCount(count); // now the canvas is back in the same state it was before the initial // call to save().

Parameters
saveCount	int: The save level to restore to.
rotate

Added in API level 1
void rotate (float degrees, 
                float px, 
                float py)
Preconcat the current matrix with the specified rotation.

Parameters
degrees	float: The amount to rotate, in degrees
px	float: The x-coord for the pivot point (unchanged by the rotation)
py	float: The y-coord for the pivot point (unchanged by the rotation)
rotate

Added in API level 1
void rotate (float degrees)
Preconcat the current matrix with the specified rotation.

Parameters
degrees	float: The amount to rotate, in degrees
save

Added in API level 1
int save (int saveFlags)
Based on saveFlags, can save the current matrix and clip onto a private stack.

Note: if possible, use the parameter-less save(). It is simpler and faster than individually disabling the saving of matrix or clip with this method.

Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect, clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated.

Parameters
saveFlags	int: flag bits that specify which parts of the Canvas state to save/restore
Returns
int	The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
save

Added in API level 1
int save ()
Saves the current matrix and clip onto a private stack.

Subsequent calls to translate,scale,rotate,skew,concat or clipRect, clipPath will all operate as usual, but when the balancing call to restore() is made, those calls will be forgotten, and the settings that existed before the save() will be reinstated.

Returns
int	The value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
saveLayer

Added in API level 21
int saveLayer (float left, 
                float top, 
                float right, 
                float bottom, 
                Paint paint)

right	float
bottom	float
paint	Paint
Returns

saveLayer

Added in API level 1
int saveLayer (RectF bounds, 
                Paint paint, 
                int saveFlags)
This behaves the same as save(), but in addition it allocates and redirects drawing to an offscreen bitmap.

Note: this method is very expensive, incurring more than double rendering cost for contained content. Avoid using this method, especially if the bounds provided are large, or if the CLIP_TO_LAYER_SAVE_FLAG is omitted from the saveFlags parameter. It is recommended to use a hardware layer on a View to apply an xfermode, color filter, or alpha, as it will perform much better than this method.

All drawing calls are directed to a newly allocated offscreen bitmap. Only when the balancing call to restore() is made, is that offscreen buffer drawn back to the current target of the Canvas (either the screen, it's target Bitmap, or the previous layer).

Attributes of the Paint - alpha, Xfermode, and ColorFilter are applied when the offscreen bitmap is drawn back when restore() is called.

Parameters
bounds	RectF: May be null. The maximum size the offscreen bitmap needs to be (in local coordinates)
paint	Paint: This is copied, and is applied to the offscreen when restore() is called.
saveFlags	int: see _SAVE_FLAG constants, generally ALL_SAVE_FLAG is recommended for performance reasons.
Returns
int	value to pass to restoreToCount() to balance this save()
